# How to change the TAX_RATE

Upon cloning this github repository (i.e., `git clone
git@github.com:lcqsigi/shopping-cart.git`). The user needs to create a `.env`
file in the `main` branch of the repository. The contents of the `.env` need to
be:

`TAX_RATE = 0.0875`  

Note the that the tax rate in NY is 8.75%. The tax rate value needs to be
updated accordingly in the `.env` file.
